# LAB 39 PubHub application

**Author**: Joshua Fredrickson

**Version**: 1.0.0 

# Overview

Lab 39 is a version of pubHub that accepts HTTP CRUD requests into a Mongo Data Base.


# Getting Started

To use the Lab 39 application, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) 
(Node Package manager), and [Mongo DB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)  will need
 to be locally installed.  Once Node.js, npm, Mongo DB have been installed, install the Lab 39 
 files.  
 Prior to starting the Lab 38 application, from the command line while you are in the Lab 39 file 
 folder, enter the command `npm i`.  This will download all needed dependencies for the 
 application to run.   


# Architecture

Node.js, npm, body-parser, dotenv, express, faker, mongoose, winston, babel, superagent, 
http-errors, jest, eslint, JavaScript, React, redux
